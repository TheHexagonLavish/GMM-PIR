<h3>Description</h3>

Described by <i>Chris Stauffer</i> and <i>W.E.L. Grimson</i> in their seminal paper, <a href=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/vsam/Publications/stauffer_cvpr98_track.pdf> "Adapative Background Mixture Models for Real-Time Tracking"</a>,
according to that paper, whenever new image data is derived, there's a recursive formula to get exponential moving statistics
for these parameters. In addition to the variables (which stand for standard deviation, incoming data vectors, covariance matrix
and parameters that manipulate the learning rate), you'll realize that the algorithm will assume large variances as the standard
and the most minute probabilities will be derived out of those functions, resulting in extremely slow convergence.


<h3>Purpose</h3>

This Gaussian mixture model will be used for background subtraction and updating the mean and covariance of the models.
